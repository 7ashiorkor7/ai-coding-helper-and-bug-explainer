# AI Coding Helper & Bug Explainer

## About the Project

This is a mini-project I am working on, driven by my interest and curiosity in educational technology. I have had my share of struggles in learning how to code when I began my journey in technology. 
Learning to code can have its fun parts and crazy moments when dealing with code bugs. We will all agree that some code bugs can give sleepless nights. 
This project brings together simple AI-powered tools to help us understand errors, get hints and practice coding in a safe environment.
